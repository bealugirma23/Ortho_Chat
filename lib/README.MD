# Hello

selot an app idea for orthodox christian to pray.

## Getting Started

# The app Brainstorm

What i'm thinking is an app that is like android default Clock app.

# features
    - it can give you notification before the alarm triggers
    - the alarm can run on background
    - you can select your preferd ringtone

## How would i do it

- I'm using packages like 
    # flutter_local_notification:
    i will use this package to send local notifications 
    # alarm:
    setting and canceling alarms
    # flutter_ringtone_player:
    i use this app to package play custom ringtones
    # Shared_prefences:
    i will use this to store and retrive the alarm settings such as time, repeat, intervals
